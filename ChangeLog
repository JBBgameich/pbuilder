	* pbuilder-checkparams : added routine to load usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc if it exists.

	* Makefile (install): added usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc default config.


	This file contains some changelog record for individual files.
	More generic info should be found in debian/changelog.
	I should probably create NEWS file, but well... it takes some
	energy. When pbuilder stabilizes, I will look at doing it.
