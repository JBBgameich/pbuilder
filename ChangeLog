	* pbuilder: modified to use umountproc_cleanbuildplace in "trap" for "pbuilder login"

	some obsolete and unnecessary cleanbuildplace invocation removed.

	* pbuilder-modules (umountproc_cleanbuildplace): changed function name.

2002-01-24  Junichi Uekawa  <dancer@debian.org>

	* pbuilder-updatebuildenv: Aborting function is performed through 
	  trap * exit. Probably others too need to be done this way.

	This file contains some changelog record for individual files.
	More generic info should be found in debian/changelog.
	I should probably create NEWS file, but well... it takes some
	energy. When pbuilder stabilizes, I will look at doing it.
