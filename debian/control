Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 Constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the 
 chroot.
 . 
 Ideal system to use to check that Build-dependency is correct, 
 and to be sure that unnecessary and wrong build dependency will not
 exist with the resulting binary package.
