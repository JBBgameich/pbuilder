Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot. It is an ideal system to use to check that a package's
 build-dependencies are correct, and to be sure that unnecessary and
 wrong build dependencies will not exist in the resulting package.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image. 
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.
