TODO and possible bugs: 
  * Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no
  package should be using it ?
  * Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have
   [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...] 
  [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.
  * cooperate with sbuild, and use sbuild if possible.
  * Please file a bug if you find that pbuilder does not exit with
  error condition on failure to  build a package.
  * Remember to update the TODO file.
