TODO and possible bugs: 

* pdebuild-internal
   - hooks should be supported (342613)
   - Use pbuilder cache in pdebuild-internal (235237)
I think I just need to add hacks to copy stuff.
   - testsuite for pdebuid-internal?

* post-etch:
   - support --allow-unauthenticated and package signiatures; #317998

pbuilder support for signatures will hopefully come

   - support readlink -e usage instead of readlink -f.

This is too trivial, but anyway. Debian 3.1 does not support 
'readlink -e'.

* xvfb:x11-common
   - debian-bug: 337541: fixed in 0.138
/etc/init.d/x11-common needs to be ran; policy-rc.d is now patched.
Remaining problem is the upgrade case, and when base.tgz already 
contains xvfb.

Maybe document the limitation.

* Need to test: amd64-x86 cross build with cowdancer 
Need to test.

* cowdancer support
   - depends-on debian-bug: 329383: now partially resolved.
0.6 is released.
cowdancer is mostly functional now. 
Where to put cowbuilder
should pbuilder be extended or cowbuilder developed further?

cowdancer 0.9 is released and most bugs are fixed, a post is posted to
debian-devel. There might be latent bugs, it might be about time to
get wider testing?

* use arrays for debbuildopts
   - current --debbuildopts usages will break, how do we support it?

* dpkg does not work in woody chroot under 2.6.11 or later kernels
   - depends-on debian-bug: 322309 dpkg: no action
   - depends-on debian-bug: 329468 debootstrap: fixed in 0.3.2
   - depends-on debian-bug: 332903 cdebootstrap: no action

* save-afer-login seems to save aptcache and make a big base.tgz.
   we don't want it, clean aptcache before save test it is functional.

* revert back to using --variant=buildd for debootstrap
   - depends-on debian-bug: 314858 debootstrap: fixed in 0.3.2

* apt authentication support
Add hooks to install gnupg package.
Allow new keys to be registered into pbuilder chroots.
Document in manual.
test

* BUG: Too many options! Creeping featurism!!

* Fix pbuilder-user-mode-linux bind-mount, 
   -  Use hostfs for better performance, 
   -  fix space-handling in, use arrays

* Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no package should be using it ?

* Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have  [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...]   [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.

* sbuild interface

* Remember to update the TODO file.

* Support for apt-move. Some, mount --bind trick 
   - documentation of how to do it
   - putting example scripts.
         
* Supporting really automatic/noninteractive "pbuilder upgrade"
   - user-mode-linux is noninteractive, it no longer umounts.
   - policy-rc.d is in place, everything should be automatic modulo bugs.

* $HOME, $TMP, $TMPDIR, etc. environment vars are set to bogus values

* set LOGNAME=root ? 
   - related debian-bug: 166682
   - perl spits out warning every time it starts up if LOGNAME is unset.

* check cross-compile support, maybe adding support for dpkg-cross into build-depends checker?

* potato su does not like dpkg-source, executes as a bash script.

* Fix UML_EXTRAOPT to use arrays.
This should change semantics; and how do we pass this thing to inside UML?

* Use alternative to pbuilder-satisfydepends; apt-pkg? read elmo.txt for clues.
