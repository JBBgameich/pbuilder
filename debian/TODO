TODO: 
  * Make pbuilder build to abort on error, and give back an errorcode.
  * Allow it to use both non-us and main archives, and have extendable list of archives, yay.
  * Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- bad sign on x packages.
  * Build conflicts do not handle versions at all. -- should never do it.
