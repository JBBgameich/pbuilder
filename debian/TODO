TODO and possible bugs: 

* BUG: Too many options! Creeping featurism!!

* Fix pbuilder-user-mode-linux bind-mount, 
   -  Use hostfs for better performance, 
   -  fix space-handling in, use arrays

* Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no package should be using it ?

* Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have  [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...]   [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.

* Creating a "sbuilder" command, which cooperates with sbuild, and use sbuild if possible.

* Please file a bug if you find that pbuilder does not exit with error condition on failure to  build a package.

* Remember to update the TODO file.

* Support for apt-move. Some, mount --bind trick 
   - documentation of how to do it
   - putting example scripts.
         
* Supporting really automatic/noninteractive "pbuilder upgrade"
   - making "start-stop-daemon" to be a dummy script?
   - using policy-rc.d ? Get people to use invoke-rc.d?
   - Killing any processes that are left over ? 
   - user-mode-linux is noninteractive, it no longer umounts.

* $HOME, $TMP, $TMPDIR, etc. environment vars are set to bogus values
* set LOGNAME=root ?

* check cross-compile support, maybe adding support for dpkg-cross into build-depends checker?

* potato su does not like dpkg-source, executes as a bash script.

* Fix UML_EXTRAOPT to use arrays.
