TODO and possible bugs: 

  * BUG: Too many options! Creeping featurism!!

  * Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no
  package should be using it ?
  * Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have
   [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...] 
  [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.
  * Creating a "sbuilder" command, which cooperates with sbuild, and 
    use sbuild if possible.
  * Please file a bug if you find that pbuilder does not exit with
  error condition on failure to  build a package.
  * Remember to update the TODO file.

  * Support for apt-move. Some, mount --bind trick ?
    - documentation of how to do it
    - updating the script hooks interface (mount / umount)
    - putting example scripts.

  * Supporting really automatic/noninteractive "pbuilder upgrade"
    - how about passing "-o dpkg::Options=--force-confnew" to apt?
    and also making "start-stop-daemon" to be a dummy script?
    (shouldn't be necessary because the config files won't be overwritten?)
    - using policy-rc.d ? Get people to use invoke-rc.d?

  * Supporting non-root users running.
    - current recommended procedure is to use a "sudo" setup.
    - is it possible to use root privilege only when required?

  * Supporting arbitrary mount --bind for inside chroot.
    - some critical checking.
    - how to clean up afterwards safely.
