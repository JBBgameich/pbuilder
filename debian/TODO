TODO and possible bugs: 
  * Make pbuilder build to abort on error, and give back an errorcode.
  * Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no package should be using it.
  * Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have
   [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...] 
  [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.
  * Now parses the .dsc file, however, the format of .dsc file is not really documented anywhere?
  * Parse the .changes file instead of guessing the resultant objects ... ? (the content of file probably changes depending on the version... not a good idea.
