TODO and possible bugs: 

* /etc/mtab is now symlink to /proc/mounts
   - document in pbuilder-doc.xml
   - mount(1)
mount(1) manual page states it will break "users" and make 'loop'
   mount inconvenient.
Check it out and document.

* Need to test: amd64-x86 cross build with cowdancer 
Need to test.

* cowdancer support
Cowdancer is not yet functional.
   - depends-on debian-bug: 329383

* use arrays for debbuildopts
   - current --debbuildopts usages will break, how do we support it?

* dpkg does not work in woody chroot under 2.6.11 or later kernels
   - depends-on debian-bug: 322309 dpkg: no action
   - depends-on debian-bug: 329468 debootstrap: fixed in 0.3.2
   - depends-on debian-bug: 332903 cdebootstrap: no action

* save-afer-login seems to save aptcache and make a big base.tgz.
   we don't want it, clean aptcache before save test it is functional.

* select cdebootstrap if debootstrap does not exist and cdebootstrap exists.

* revert back to using --variant=buildd for debootstrap
   - depends-on debian-bug: 314858 debootstrap: fixed in 0.3.2

* apt authentication support
Add hooks to install gnupg package.
Allow new keys to be registered into pbuilder chroots.
Document in manual.
test

* Use pbuilder cache in pdebuild-internal (235237)

* BUG: Too many options! Creeping featurism!!

* Fix pbuilder-user-mode-linux bind-mount, 
   -  Use hostfs for better performance, 
   -  fix space-handling in, use arrays

* Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no package should be using it ?

* Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have  [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...]   [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.

* sbuild interface

* Remember to update the TODO file.

* Support for apt-move. Some, mount --bind trick 
   - documentation of how to do it
   - putting example scripts.
         
* Supporting really automatic/noninteractive "pbuilder upgrade"
   - user-mode-linux is noninteractive, it no longer umounts.
   - policy-rc.d is in place, everything should be automatic modulo bugs.

* $HOME, $TMP, $TMPDIR, etc. environment vars are set to bogus values

* set LOGNAME=root ? 
   - related debian-bug: 166682

* check cross-compile support, maybe adding support for dpkg-cross into build-depends checker?

* potato su does not like dpkg-source, executes as a bash script.

* Fix UML_EXTRAOPT to use arrays.

* Use alternative to pbuilder-satisfydepends; apt-pkg? read elmo.txt for clues.
