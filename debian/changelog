pbuilder (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * "The version that seems to be able to successfully build most of 
    Debian archive"
  * pbuilder-buildpackage accepts case insensitive field name 
    for "Build-depends" to cope with some packages like bzip2. (closes: #133054)
  * pbuilder create/update will use cached packages in addition to
    "build". However, the packages fed to debootstrap are not cached.
  * Supports Build-Depends without spaces like freefem (closes: #133162)
  * Version requirement on debootstrap bumped up to the
    fixed version, 0.1.16.2.
    That package is installed at last.
  * Documentation updates
  * Messages improvement, for automatic operation
  * Adding check for empty-cache state.

pbuilder (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Accept "Noninteractive" like "noninteractive" as value of DEBIAN_FRONTEND,
    for compatibility with other (broken?) software.
  * Changed the dpkg-buildpackage -S invocation inside pdebuild.
    It should be more friendly for dpkg-buildpackage and its intentions, and 
    mostly backward compatible behavior.
  * added build-time logging data to pbuilder-buildpackage.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Feb 2002 19:17:51 +0900

pbuilder (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Really addressing some bugs"
  * --othermirror option fixed. Thanks go to kov@debian.org for 
    pointing that out (closes: #131726).
  * --aptconfdir option. It is now possible to specify 
    --aptconfdir /etc/apt to use the system configs. 
    (closes: #116115)
  * some minor fixes.
  * banner for version info is given in build target.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Feb 2002 01:12:41 +0900

pbuilder (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * "I know that the debootstrap version in sid doesn't work. 
    You need to fix the mistakes in debootstrap." release
  * Improved "pbuilder update/create/build" temp file cleaning process,
    so that in most cases it will be cleaned. In some conditions, temp
    file will still remain, but really, there is not much atomicity in shell?
  * pbuilder.1 typo fixed.
  * --logfile option now seems to function properly, as expected.
  * ~/.pbuilderrc is checked for user configs. (closes: #131181)
  * more documentation, noting about dangers of mount --bind.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Jan 2002 19:09:11 +0900

pbuilder (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version, "Trying to address some wishlists" 
  * Added usr/share/pbuilder/pbuilderrc for default configuration.
  * Apply $@ -> "$@" fix from Daniel Kobras.
  * Apply the patch from Daniel Kobras for specifying options to 
    dpkg-buildpacakge invocation in pbuilder-buildpacakge.
    It should be possible to build binary-only uploads etc.
    (closes: #129221)

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Jan 2002 12:58:15 +0900

pbuilder (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * new version, "Documentation updates and cosmetic fixes". 
  * pbuilder.1, pbuilderrc.5: update to document problem with file:/ URLs
    if specified as mirrorsite (pbuilder is about chroots)
  * debian/TODO: updated - notes on apt-move archives, and other things.
  * debian/control: updated the dependency requirement of
    debootstrap (>= 0.1.15.5) see bug #126458 for a consequence.
  * debian/README.Debian: updated the testsuite info, and some descriptions
    are rewritten.
  * README: updated.
  * pbuilder-modules: no longer includes "deb-src" lines in the apt config.
    Source is not required at all by pbuilder. Some message cleanup.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Jan 2002 09:29:42 +0900

pbuilder (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * pbuilder-modules: Fixed a typo, which made it to create a broken
    sources.list if MIRRORSITE was not specified. 
  * pbuilder-modules: Shuffled the orderings so that OTHERMIRROR takes the
    priority.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Dec 2001 00:12:25 +0900

pbuilder (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a little more heuristics to pdebuild, so that it is nicer to use...
    It will search for ../debian directory, in addition to ./debian,
    and also to recurse upwards.
  * updated manpage for pdebuild.1

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Dec 2001 15:28:44 +0900

pbuilder (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the test build-depends etc. from the debian/control.
    (closes: #124192), it really should not be there.
    The original debian/control is left as debian/control.test,
    so that testing can be done easily, by cp debian/control{.test,}

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Dec 2001 23:35:50 +0900

pbuilder (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * pdebuild could not handle packages with an epoch. Fixed.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Dec 2001 18:17:55 +0900

pbuilder (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The last version had a typo... bug 120057 was the one to close, not
    12057 :P
  * A hook to check the current command-line operation, and
    not to do the "exec < /dev/null" when it is trying to do
    "login" is implemented, so that it is actually possible to
    log in with noninteractive mode enabled. At the request of
    steven.robbins@videotron.ca (closes: #120064)
  * Check for failures in umounting proc, and retry with a little
    wait to see if something happens.
    Will start up a command-line if something fails, and ask for
    some remedy.
  * It will now parse debian/control file with multi-line
    Build-Depends line or Build-Conflicts line (closes: #120718)
    However, I don't think the policy really permits this very clearly.
    There are packages which exist doing this, and other tools do support this.
  * --logfile option added. Log file can now be specified.
  * fixed pbuilder.1, and pbuilderrc.5 so that it can be processed
    correctly by WoMan. (removed some .PP)
    and fixed some awkwardness in text.
  * Added some error checking to pbuilder-buildpackage to give more
    information when base.tgz has not been created (yet).
  * updating TODO file

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Fri, 30 Nov 2001 00:05:37 +0900

pbuilder (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing some minor glitch. pdebuild should be calling dpkg-buildpackage with -us -uc.
  * changed pdebuild logic in obtaining version number, from using 
    grep/cut to sed.
  * fixed build-conflicts logic. It failed when build-conflicted target did not 
    already exist inside chroot.
  * README.Debian is updated.
  * Added a nonexistent package to Build-Conflicts of debian/control, so that 
    it will be possible to catch such possible error.
  * patch from fbiere@abacom.com, fixes build-dependency with 
    OR conditions. It used to try out all. (closes: #119541)
  * Redundant "case" removed from pbuilder-createbasetgz. 
    (it was introduced in 0.10).
    Thanks go to Steve for pointing this out.
    (closes: #12057)
  * Fixed the reverse-logic for the "distribution is not specified"
    line in pbuilder-modules. Thanks for steven.robbins@videotron.ca
    (again) for pointing this out. (closes: #120063)

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2001 17:56:06 +0900

pbuilder (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch for full non-interactive compilation by
    Daniel Kobras (kobras@debian.org) applied. (closes: #116891)
    However, note that doing this will result in "pbuilder login" being very
    uninteresting.
  * Depends on gcc, because debootstrap does not seem to function well
    without gcc. Actually, dpkg does not work without gcc, when it is asked
    questions about the "architecture."
  * Now dpkg-buildpackage is invoked with DEBEMAIL as maintainer.
    It can be overridden with command line option. To build it like :
     dpkg-buildpackage -mdancer@debian.org"
    the command-line would be like:
     pbuiler build --debemail dancer@debian.org package.dsc
  * dpkg-buildpackage is being called with -us -uc
  * site local /etc/passwd is no longer copied to inside chroot.
    Copying of that file was never really required, as it seems.
  * use "set -e" at the beginning of shell scripts.
    It should work fine.
  * "cleaning the build env" message is prepended with ->
  * error state for cp for finished work in pbuilder-buildpackage
    is now ignored. (to work with set -e)
  * full non-interactive compilation patch, moved over to
    pbuilder-modules, so that build/update/create all benefit from this.
  * cleans build place on debootstrap failure.
  * A new command "pdebuild" is introduced. It can be invoked
    from a Debian source tree, and builds the package within a chroot
    after gaining root privilages appropriately.
  * added recommends: for fakeroot and sudo, since pdebuild requires 
    them.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Nov 2001 23:56:12 +0900

pbuilder (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * allow use of hardlinks in apt cache handling, with new option
    APTCACHEHARDLINK. This cannot be enabled if pbuilder
    files are distributed among filesystems.
    It should speed up processing.
  * Depends on wget, since debootstrap only recommends, and I think this
    program is not quite functional as it is without wget
  * fix runhook breakage introduced by my hacking around with quotes.
  * Make runhook work as advertized in pbuilder.1 manpage. (closes: #116416)
  * added DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to the config file. This
    suppresses debconf questions.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Oct 2001 23:38:22 +0900

pbuilder (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * support custom debootstrap scripts, requested by amon@vnl.com
    (closes: #114691)
  * changed hook handler. hopefully it should work if the directory is
    not called a hookdir ...
  * changed "hooks" variable in pbuilder-runhooks, to not to have
    a starting "/". It should be unnecessary
  * E: messages in pbuilder-runhooks are now "W:" messages, because
    even when those errors are detected, they should not really
    stop the execution of pbuilder halfway.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Oct 2001 01:58:34 +0900

pbuilder (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixing manpage section
  * Adding --configfile option, to load random config file.
  * Adding --extrapackages option, to load random additional
  * Merging some patches from Dale, with some modifications to
    fit my taste. his changelog was :
    o Wrote pbuilder-runhooks and integrated it into the create and
      update scripts.
    o Added HOOKDIR to configuration options
    o Added --hookdir to command line options
     Updated man pages for pbuilder and pbuilderrc
    o Added defaulting/error checks of a couple key variables in
      pbuilder-checkparams.
    o Added /usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks default hook directory to debian/dirs

    oo  Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Wed, 26 Sep 2001 23:49:00 +0001
  * when HOOKDIR is not set, scripts won't be ran.
    It is a security risk to be able to run any random script as
    root, so be aware of this when setting "HOOKDIR".
  * debian/control: removed ${shlibs:Depends}, because there is none.
  * fixing logic error in updatebuildenv.
  * removed pushd and popd from runhooks, just because
    I don't think it looks cute.
  * updated README file, to have some contents
  * Added displaying what's copied in build target, parsing of .dsc.
    and changed pbuilder-buildpackage .dsc parser.
    It used to catch a bogus entry, something like  "./",
    which is now fixed.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Oct 2001 00:08:31 +0900

pbuilder (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for /etc/pbuilderrc configuration file.
    Should help people understand what is going on...
  * Added a feature of caching the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives
    inside the chroot. It's not quite apt-move, but this should do the
    trick ?
  * pbuilder clean will clean the apt cache.
  * REMOVEPACKAGES is a configurable option now.
    Please be warned, if you are upgrading, that "lilo" might be left
    on your chroot, which could potentially cause nasty damage.
  * added /var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache directory
  * A bug with .dsc file parser which caused some annoying error messages 
    has been fixed.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Sep 2001 00:12:47 +0900

pbuilder (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed logic error in invocation to apt-cache.
  * Parsing of .dsc file is implemented, hoping not to have broken anything.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Sep 2001 06:37:08 +0900

pbuilder (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating notes on upstream page
  * moving routines around in arch-dep checker... hoping not to have
    broken anything.
  * Handles provides: in build dependency, parsing apt-cache showpkg 
    output for reverse-dependency, and randomly installing one of the
    available packages.
  * Now it seems to be able to build (or satisfy the build dependency of)
    glibc, gcc-2.95 et al.
  * Handles versioned deps and conflicts.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2001 18:56:14 +0900

pbuilder (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * note that --mirror only affects when --distribution is there.
  * fixed a typo in regexp. Could not handle NMU packages, for builder. It did not accept a "period" in the debian version number. strange.
  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on 0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used instead of dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * does no longer copy the /etc/apt directory into the chroot. It should be non-necessary.
  * added a clean target to pbuilder program to clean up cruft.
  * removed the debian-changelog-mode thing at the bottom of the changelog.
  * added login target to pbuilder, to allow for easy debugging.
  * fixed typo in apt-line generation
  * added an or-sign for build-dependency internal checker, and moving
    over fully to the internal checker. Build dep checker does not support 
    a Build depends with an or sign and a machine specification.
    Also it ignores the version preference.
  * change priority to extra, because it depends on an extra package.
    thanks to mechanix.
  * added non-us mirror and other mirror options

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Sep 2001 15:27:28 +0900

pbuilder (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian archive. (closes: #110388)
  * Add a versioned depends on debootstrap, because that version is the only
    version I tested on ... 0.1.15.2
  * --mirror option is fixed. it works now.
  * proc is not mounted when debootstrap is running in create, should fix problems.

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Aug 2001 19:44:34 +0900

pbuilder (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
