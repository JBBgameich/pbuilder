pbuilder (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch for full non-interactive compilation by
    Daniel Kobras (kobras@debian.org) applied. (closes: #116891)
  * Depends on gcc, because debootstrap does not seem to function well
    without gcc. Actually, dpkg does not work without gcc, when it is asked
    questions about the "architecture."
  * Add support for specifying modifier. Thus, forcing pbuilder to build
    with 
     dpkg-buildpackage -mdancer@debian.org" 
    should be possible via 
     pbuiler build --debemail dancer@debian.org package.dsc

pbuilder (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * allow use of hardlinks in apt cache handling, with new option
    APTCACHEHARDLINK. This cannot be enabled if pbuilder
    files are distributed among filesystems.
    It should speed up processing.
  * Depends on wget, since debootstrap only recommends, and I think this
    program is not quite functional as it is without wget
  * fix runhook breakage introduced by my hacking around with quotes.
  * Make runhook work as advertized in pbuilder.1 manpage. (closes: #116416)
  * added DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to the config file. This
    suppresses debconf questions.

pbuilder (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * support custom debootstrap scripts, requested by amon@vnl.com
    (closes: #114691)
  * changed hook handler. hopefully it should work if the directory is
    not called a hookdir ...
  * changed "hooks" variable in pbuilder-runhooks, to not to have
    a starting "/". It should be unnecessary
  * E: messages in pbuilder-runhooks are now "W:" messages, because
    even when those errors are detected, they should not really
    stop the execution of pbuilder halfway.

pbuilder (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixing manpage section
  * Adding --configfile option, to load random config file.
  * Adding --extrapackages option, to load random additional
  * Merging some patches from Dale, with some modifications to
    fit my taste. his changelog was :
    o Wrote pbuilder-runhooks and integrated it into the create and
      update scripts.
    o Added HOOKDIR to configuration options
    o Added --hookdir to command line options
     Updated man pages for pbuilder and pbuilderrc
    o Added defaulting/error checks of a couple key variables in
      pbuilder-checkparams.
    o Added /usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks default hook directory to debian/dirs

    oo  Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Wed, 26 Sep 2001 23:49:00 +0001
  * when HOOKDIR is not set, scripts won't be ran.
    It is a security risk to be able to run any random script as
    root, so be aware of this when setting "HOOKDIR".
  * debian/control: removed ${shlibs:Depends}, because there is none.
  * fixing logic error in updatebuildenv.
  * removed pushd and popd from runhooks, just because
    I don't think it looks cute.
  * updated README file, to have some contents
  * Added displaying what's copied in build target, parsing of .dsc.
    and changed pbuilder-buildpackage .dsc parser.
    It used to catch a bogus entry, something like  "./",
    which is now fixed.

pbuilder (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for /etc/pbuilderrc configuration file.
    Should help people understand what is going on...
  * Added a feature of caching the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives
    inside the chroot. It's not quite apt-move, but this should do the
    trick ?
  * pbuilder clean will clean the apt cache.
  * REMOVEPACKAGES is a configurable option now.
    Please be warned, if you are upgrading, that "lilo" might be left
    on your chroot, which could potentially cause nasty damage.
  * added /var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache directory
  * A bug with .dsc file parser which caused some annoying error messages 
    has been fixed.

pbuilder (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed logic error in invocation to apt-cache.
  * Parsing of .dsc file is implemented, hoping not to have broken anything.

pbuilder (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updating notes on upstream page
  * moving routines around in arch-dep checker... hoping not to have
    broken anything.
  * Handles provides: in build dependency, parsing apt-cache showpkg 
    output for reverse-dependency, and randomly installing one of the
    available packages.
  * Now it seems to be able to build (or satisfy the build dependency of)
    glibc, gcc-2.95 et al.
  * Handles versioned deps and conflicts.

pbuilder (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * note that --mirror only affects when --distribution is there.
  * fixed a typo in regexp. Could not handle NMU packages, for builder. It did not accept a "period" in the debian version number. strange.
  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on 0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used instead of dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * does no longer copy the /etc/apt directory into the chroot. It should be non-necessary.
  * added a clean target to pbuilder program to clean up cruft.
  * removed the debian-changelog-mode thing at the bottom of the changelog.
  * added login target to pbuilder, to allow for easy debugging.
  * fixed typo in apt-line generation
  * added an or-sign for build-dependency internal checker, and moving
    over fully to the internal checker. Build dep checker does not support 
    a Build depends with an or sign and a machine specification.
    Also it ignores the version preference.
  * change priority to extra, because it depends on an extra package.
    thanks to mechanix.
  * added non-us mirror and other mirror options

pbuilder (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian archive. (closes: #110388)
  * Add a versioned depends on debootstrap, because that version is the only
    version I tested on ... 0.1.15.2
  * --mirror option is fixed. it works now.
  * proc is not mounted when debootstrap is running in create, should fix problems.

pbuilder (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
