  * "Fixing the personal side of the pbuilder", release
  * Build-Dependency version checking improved, should work slightly better
    when multiple versions are available (reported by jbouse@debian.org)
  * logic-error on DEBEMAIL handling fixed. When it was blank,
    it was set to "nobody@nowhere", but that shouldn't be necessary.
    (closes: #136628, #137411)
  * pbuilderrc: change the default config so that binary and source is built
  * ignore build-depends in package lines and only use those found in the
    source lines.
  * debian/TODO: updated.
  * pbuilder-satisfydepends: split out the dependency satisfaction
    code, so that it can be used genericly. Or replaced with other
    programs, such as sbuild. However, sbuild reads .dsc files, while
    pbuilder parses debian/control.
  * fixed regexp for multi-line build-*: field processing.
  * Add "D" scripts, for after chroot setup, and before extracting
    source packages inside the chroot, on build target.

  * Accept "Noninteractive" like "noninteractive" as value of DEBIAN_FRONTEND,

  * Changed the dpkg-buildpackage -S invocation inside pdebuild.
    It should be more friendly for dpkg-buildpackage and its intentions, and 
    mostly backward compatible behavior.

  * debian/README.Debian: updated the testsuite info, and some descriptions
    are rewritten.

    The original debian/control is left as debian/control.test,
    so that testing can be done easily, by cp debian/control{.test,}

pbuilder (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The last version had a typo... bug 120057 was the one to close, not
    12057 :P
  * A hook to check the current command-line operation, and
    not to do the "exec < /dev/null" when it is trying to do
    "login" is implemented, so that it is actually possible to
    log in with noninteractive mode enabled. At the request of
    steven.robbins@videotron.ca (closes: #120064)
  * Check for failures in umounting proc, and retry with a little
    wait to see if something happens.
    Will start up a command-line if something fails, and ask for
    some remedy.
  * It will now parse debian/control file with multi-line
    Build-Depends line or Build-Conflicts line (closes: #120718)
    However, I don't think the policy really permits this very clearly.
    There are packages which exist doing this, and other tools do support this.
  * --logfile option added. Log file can now be specified.
  * fixed pbuilder.1, and pbuilderrc.5 so that it can be processed
    correctly by WoMan. (removed some .PP)
    and fixed some awkwardness in text.
  * Added some error checking to pbuilder-buildpackage to give more
    information when base.tgz has not been created (yet).
  * updating TODO file

pbuilder (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing some minor glitch. pdebuild should be calling dpkg-buildpackage with -us -uc.
  * changed pdebuild logic in obtaining version number, from using 
    grep/cut to sed.
  * fixed build-conflicts logic. It failed when build-conflicted target did not 
    already exist inside chroot.
  * README.Debian is updated.
  * Added a nonexistent package to Build-Conflicts of debian/control, so that 
    it will be possible to catch such possible error.
  * patch from fbiere@abacom.com, fixes build-dependency with 
    OR conditions. It used to try out all. (closes: #119541)
  * Redundant "case" removed from pbuilder-createbasetgz. 
    (it was introduced in 0.10).
    Thanks go to Steve for pointing this out.

pbuilder (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch for full non-interactive compilation by
    Daniel Kobras (kobras@debian.org) applied. (closes: #116891)
    However, note that doing this will result in "pbuilder login" being very
    uninteresting.
  * Depends on gcc, because debootstrap does not seem to function well
    without gcc. Actually, dpkg does not work without gcc, when it is asked
    questions about the "architecture."
  * Now dpkg-buildpackage is invoked with DEBEMAIL as maintainer.
    It can be overridden with command line option. To build it like :
     dpkg-buildpackage -mdancer@debian.org"
    the command-line would be like:
     pbuiler build --debemail dancer@debian.org package.dsc
  * dpkg-buildpackage is being called with -us -uc
  * site local /etc/passwd is no longer copied to inside chroot.
    Copying of that file was never really required, as it seems.
  * use "set -e" at the beginning of shell scripts.
    It should work fine.
  * "cleaning the build env" message is prepended with ->
  * error state for cp for finished work in pbuilder-buildpackage
    is now ignored. (to work with set -e)
  * full non-interactive compilation patch, moved over to
    pbuilder-modules, so that build/update/create all benefit from this.
  * cleans build place on debootstrap failure.
  * A new command "pdebuild" is introduced. It can be invoked
    from a Debian source tree, and builds the package within a chroot
    after gaining root privilages appropriately.
  * added recommends: for fakeroot and sudo, since pdebuild requires 
    them.

pbuilder (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * allow use of hardlinks in apt cache handling, with new option
    APTCACHEHARDLINK. This cannot be enabled if pbuilder
    files are distributed among filesystems.
    It should speed up processing.
  * Depends on wget, since debootstrap only recommends, and I think this
    program is not quite functional as it is without wget
  * fix runhook breakage introduced by my hacking around with quotes.
  * Make runhook work as advertized in pbuilder.1 manpage. (closes: #116416)
  * added DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive to the config file. This
    suppresses debconf questions.

pbuilder (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * support custom debootstrap scripts, requested by amon@vnl.com
    (closes: #114691)
  * changed hook handler. hopefully it should work if the directory is
    not called a hookdir ...
  * changed "hooks" variable in pbuilder-runhooks, to not to have
    a starting "/". It should be unnecessary
  * E: messages in pbuilder-runhooks are now "W:" messages, because
    even when those errors are detected, they should not really
    stop the execution of pbuilder halfway.

  * Merging some patches from Dale, with some modifications to
    fit my taste. his changelog was :
    o Wrote pbuilder-runhooks and integrated it into the create and
      update scripts.
    o Added HOOKDIR to configuration options
    o Added --hookdir to command line options
     Updated man pages for pbuilder and pbuilderrc
    o Added defaulting/error checks of a couple key variables in
      pbuilder-checkparams.
    o Added /usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks default hook directory to debian/dirs

    oo  Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Wed, 26 Sep 2001 23:49:00 +0001
  * when HOOKDIR is not set, scripts won't be ran.
    It is a security risk to be able to run any random script as
    root, so be aware of this when setting "HOOKDIR".
  * debian/control: removed ${shlibs:Depends}, because there is none.
  * fixing logic error in updatebuildenv.
  * removed pushd and popd from runhooks, just because
    I don't think it looks cute.
  * updated README file, to have some contents
  * Added displaying what's copied in build target, parsing of .dsc.
    and changed pbuilder-buildpackage .dsc parser.
    It used to catch a bogus entry, something like  "./",
    which is now fixed.

pbuilder (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for /etc/pbuilderrc configuration file.
    Should help people understand what is going on...
  * Added a feature of caching the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives
    inside the chroot. It's not quite apt-move, but this should do the
    trick ?
  * pbuilder clean will clean the apt cache.
  * REMOVEPACKAGES is a configurable option now.
    Please be warned, if you are upgrading, that "lilo" might be left
    on your chroot, which could potentially cause nasty damage.
  * added /var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache directory
  * A bug with .dsc file parser which caused some annoying error messages 
    has been fixed.

    broken anything.
  * Handles provides: in build dependency, parsing apt-cache showpkg 
    output for reverse-dependency, and randomly installing one of the
    available packages.

    glibc, gcc-2.95 et al.

  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on 0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used instead of dpkg-checkbuilddeps.
  * does no longer copy the /etc/apt directory into the chroot. It should be non-necessary.
  * added a clean target to pbuilder program to clean up cruft.
  * removed the debian-changelog-mode thing at the bottom of the changelog.
  * added login target to pbuilder, to allow for easy debugging.
  * fixed typo in apt-line generation
  * added an or-sign for build-dependency internal checker, and moving
    over fully to the internal checker. Build dep checker does not support 
    a Build depends with an or sign and a machine specification.
    Also it ignores the version preference.
  * change priority to extra, because it depends on an extra package.
    thanks to mechanix.
