  * fixed a typo in regexp. Could not handle NMU packages, for builder. It did not accept a "period" in the debian version number. strange.
  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on 0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep (crude hack) to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is not available.
  This really needs to be fixed.
