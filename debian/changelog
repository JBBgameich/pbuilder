pbuilder (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * note that --mirror only affects when --distribution is there.
  * fixed a typo in regexp. Could not handle NMU packages, for builder. It did not accept a "period" in the debian version number. strange.
  * depend on debootstrap 0.1.15 or greater. Because it has been tested on 0.1.15
  * includes an internal checkbuilddep (crude hack) to support potato.
  Internal build-dependency checker is used when dpkg-checkbuilddeps is not available.
  This really needs to be fixed.
  * does no longer copy the /etc/apt directory into the chroot. It should be non-necessary.
  * added a clean target to pbuilder program to clean up cruft.
  * removed the debian-changelog-mode thing at the bottom of the changelog.
  * added login target to pbuilder, to allow for easy debugging.
  * fixed typo in apt-line generation
  * added an or-sign for build-dependency internal checker, and moving
    over fully to the internal checker.
  * change priority to extra, because it depends on an extra package.
    thanks to mechanix.
  * added non-us mirror and other mirror options
