pbuilder for Debian
------------------------

This is a personal builder.

Try: 
  pbuilder create --distribution woody
to create the initial build env.

  pbuilder update
would update


pbuilder build some-random-.dsc 

would build the file specified by the .dsc file in the chroot.



edit /etc/pbuilderrc if the default doesn't work, especially proxy.
I would edit the mirror location too.
Add non-us etc, at your option.
