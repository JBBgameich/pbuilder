pbuilder for Debian
------------------------

This is a personal builder.

Try: 
  pbuilder-createbuildenv woody
to create the initial build env.

  pbuilder-updatebuildenv woody
would update

It won't work with Debian 2.2, because dpkg-checkbuilddeps 
does not exist yet in Debian 2.2.

edit /etc/pbuilderrc if the default doesn't work, especially proxy.
