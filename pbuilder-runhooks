# $HOOKDIR is set in /etc/pbuilderrc and contains a list of executable
# programs or scripts. The type is only limited by what you expect will
# be available in your chrooted environment after debootstrap has done
# an initial install. The functions muxt be named in the format:
# <prefex><digit><digit><descriptive name>. Currently only X is defined;
# scripts prefixed with X will be run just before the chroot environment
# is exited and the base.tgz file is created or updated.
